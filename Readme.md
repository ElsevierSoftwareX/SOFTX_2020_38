## How to test best model
```
To test the model generated by Gsgp-Cuda it is necessary to provide by command line the name of the files to be executed, 
the first parameter indicates the name of the test data file, 
the second parameter indicates the name of the model file and finally the name of the file to save the model output values.

./GsgpCuda.x -test_file test.txt -trace_file trace2021-10-08.11:36:25.csv -output_file xxx

## Documentation:
```
The documentation of the library is a Doxygen documentation. The implementation has been done in order to use the library after a very quick reading of the documentation.
